  paragraphOne:
    'My coaching is an invitation for a deep change toward fulfilling potential. Accessing to your natural creativity and resourcefulness will turn aspirations to reality.',
  paragraphTwo:
    'A coaching process usually begins with an exploration of who you are, who you wish to be and what you want to create. Your fulfilling vision will serve as a your north star to navigate through. Crafting a roadmap will support you to follow up your experiment and practices.',
  paragraphThree:
    'Straightforward conversation with inquiries exposes what is underneath your struggles, reveals your (hidden) values and underlines what really matters to you. Improvisation, playfulness and light meditation open up exploration and go beyond your boundary. Brainstorming, actions learning and experimental practices help to develop new skills and behavior. ',
  paragraphFour:
    'You are most likely experiencing self-awareness, connection to your inner knowing, power of choice and appreciation. You will also be able to see through what is happening, aligning your life values and triggering pattern interruptions. This will create room for your resilience and authenticity to show up.',

    'In a small neighborhood of Saigon, a group of kids ran to be the first. Neither winning nor running interested me, staying aside became a habit. The past had to hide, survival was the present, and the future felt liked a dark hole. Mixture of being poor and fear, escape postulated as alternative. That is how the world presented itself to me',
  paragraphTwo:
    'After landing in Paris, the western dream turned into an illusion. Graduating as an engineer felt like a breakthrough. In a pursuit of success, I moved to San Francisco. On the top of the hill, the doubt kept persisting: “Is it the right mountain to climb?” I tried to find an answer by backpacking in the woods, traveling through undeveloped countries and practicing yoga. What seemed familiar was the connection to nature, people, emptiness and uncertainty.',
  paragraphThree:
    'Down to the valley of despair, it was a wake up call for inner exploration and being an artist. Exhibitions were always a challenge to reveal who I am. My vision of success and happiness felt borrowed from someone else. The “American dream” reached its end. A big shift had to happen. Courage was not there with me at first: moving out of San Francisco!',
  paragraphFour:
    'What is next and what for? Konstanz, a conscious choice of life shift. Whatever I had already accomplished vanished, experiences remain. The completion of my coaching training allowed to see through my journey and draws a new path: the co-experiencing of other people’s transformative expedition.',
