    'Most clients come to me for various reasons: leadership competency, personal development, career perspective, relationship deepening or even burn-out. They often asked why they did not engage with coaching earlier.',
  paragraphTwo:
    'The answer seems obvious at first, for instance a challenging job, a conflict resolution or developing new skills. Slowly, other aspects show up and matters get more complex, for example dependencies or an interaction with others.',
  paragraphThree:
    'When change at some point is necessary, which one are you? Feeling stuck is a wake up call for redirection. There is no shortcut for getting a clarity what really matters and going for it. What holds you back to go through?',
  paragraphFour:
    'It begins by creating room and time. Shifting a perspective does not come naturally without stirring it up. What you resist, persists. What could help is someone to mirror you, to raise questions that you did not ask yourself yet, and to be there when courage and support is needed.',

    'This is where coaching comes in. The coach is a sparring partner and co-traveller of your journey of change.',

To get a good idea of what to expect and if we can work together, feel free to contact me for a conversation. Please send me an email to thelan@co-act.space.',
  paragraphTwo:
    'The length of the coaching process and frequency of sessions are determined accordingly with the client. I recommend a package of 8 sessions of 50 minutes over a period of four months to allow a certain level of depth and sustainability. I coach via Zoom, over the phone or inperson.',

  paragraphOne:
    'In a small neighborhood of Saigon, a group of kids ran to be the first. Neither winning nor running interested me, staying aside became a habit. The past had to hide, survival was the present, and the future felt liked a dark hole. Mixture of being poor and fear, escape postulated as alternative. That is how the world presented itself to me',
  paragraphTwo:
    'After landing in Paris, the western dream turned into an illusion. Graduating as an engineer felt like a breakthrough. In a pursuit of success, I moved to San Francisco. On the top of the hill, the doubt kept persisting: “Is it the right mountain to climb?” I tried to find an answer by backpacking in the woods, traveling through undeveloped countries and practicing yoga. What seemed familiar was the connection to nature, people, emptiness and uncertainty.',
  paragraphThree:
    'Down to the valley of despair, it was a wake up call for inner exploration and being an artist. Exhibitions were always a challenge to reveal who I am. My vision of success and happiness felt borrowed from someone else. The “American dream” reached its end. A big shift had to happen. Courage was not there with me at first: moving out of San Francisco!',
  paragraphFour:
    'What is next and what for? Konstanz, a conscious choice of life shift. Whatever I had already accomplished vanished, experiences remain. The completion of my coaching training allowed to see through my journey and draws a new path: the co-experiencing of other people’s transformative expedition.',
